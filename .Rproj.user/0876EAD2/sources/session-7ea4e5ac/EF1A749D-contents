# Introduction

This report details a reproducibility study of one specific instrument
from Ewa Dąbrowska's (2019) research: the test for **Language Analytic
Ability**. The analysis examines the instrument itself, its application
in comparing native (L1) and nonnative (L2) speakers, and the
statistical and visual reproduction of the paper's key findings using R.

The analysis is based on the data and claims presented in:

-   Dąbrowska, Ewa. 2019. Experience, Aptitude, and Individual
    Differences in Linguistic Attainment: A Comparison of Native and
    Nonnative Speakers. *Language Learning* 69(S1). 72-100.

## Setup
# This chunk loads all necessary libraries and prepares the data for analysis.
# It is hidden in the final output but is essential for the code to run.

# Load libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(effectsize)
library(here)

# Load the datasets from local files
l1_data <- read_csv(file = here("data", "L1_data.csv"))
l2_data <- read_csv(file = here("data", "L2_data.csv"))

# convert to character type
l1_data <- l1_data |> mutate(Participant = as.character(Participant))
l2_data <- l2_data |> mutate(Participant = as.character(Participant))

# Add a 'Group' identifier to each dataset
l1_data$Group <- "L1"
l2_data$Group <- "L2"

# Combine the datasets and select only the columns needed for this analysis
combined_data <- bind_rows(l1_data, l2_data) |>
  select(Group, LgAnalysis, Vocab)
```

# The Testing Instrument: Language Analytic Ability

Before diving into the data, it's important to understand the tool used
to measure Language Analytic Ability.

-   *Who developed it and when?*

    The test used in Dabrowska's study is the Language Analysis subtest
    of the Pimsleur Language Aptitude Battery (PLAB), developed by
    Pimsleur, Reed, and Stansfield in 2004.

-   *For what purpose?*

    Language Analytic Ability is the ability to infer linguistic rules
    and generalizations, and therefore an important skill in regards to
    grammar.

-   *How it works:*

    Participants are presented with some vocabulary and sentences in an
    unknown language. From these, they were supposed to predict the form
    of a new sentence.

## Descriptive Statistics

The first step in the reproduction is the calculation of descriptive
statistics for the `LgAnalysis` scores for both L1 and L2 groups. This
verifies that the dataset used matches the sample characteristics of the
original study.

```{r}
#| label: descriptive-stats
#| echo: false

# Calculate descriptive statistics using dplyr
descriptive_stats <- combined_data |> 
  group_by(Group) |> 
  summarise(
    Count = n(),
    Mean = mean(LgAnalysis, na.rm = TRUE),
    `Std. Dev.` = sd(LgAnalysis, na.rm = TRUE),
    Min = min(LgAnalysis, na.rm = TRUE),
    Max = max(LgAnalysis, na.rm = TRUE),
    Range = Max - Min
  )

# Display the results in a clean, formatted table
kable(descriptive_stats, 
      caption = "Descriptive Statistics for Language Analytic Ability Scores",
      digits = 2)
```

*Interpretation:* The table shows that the L2 group (Mean = 9.64)
exhibits a higher mean score on the Language Analytic Ability test than
the L1 group (Mean = 7.59). The standard deviation is also larger for
the L2 group, indicating slightly more variability in their scores.The
range of scores is similar for both groups (L1 = 15, L2 = 14).

# Statistical Analysis

The analysis now moves beyond description to test whether the observed
differences and relationships are statistically significant.

## Testing the Difference Between Groups (t-test)

An independent samples t-test is performed to determine if the
difference in mean `LgAnalysis` scores between the L1 and L2 groups is
statistically significant.

```{r}
#| label: t-test
#| echo: false

# Perform an independent samples t-test
t_test_result <- t.test(LgAnalysis ~ Group, data = combined_data)

# Print the full result of the t-test
print(t_test_result)
```

*Interpretation:* The t-test yields a p-value of
`r round(t_test_result$p.value, 4)`. As this value is well below the
conventional significance level of α = 0.05, the null hypothesis is
rejected. This provides strong statistical evidence that the higher mean
score of the L2 group is not due to random chance.

As this value is well below the conventional significance level of α =
0.05, the null hypothesis is rejected.

## Testing the Relationship with Vocabulary (Correlation)

Dąbrowska (2019) reports that `LgAnalysis` is a significant predictor of
vocabulary for L2 learners but not for L1 learners in her regression
models (p. 87). This claim is tested here using separate bivariate
correlation tests for each group.

### *L2 Group Correlation:*

```{r}
#| label: cor-l2
#| echo: false

# Filter for L2 group and run correlation test
cor_l2 <- cor.test(~ LgAnalysis + Vocab, data = filter(combined_data, Group == "L2"))
print(cor_l2)
```

*Interpretation (L2):* For the L2 group, the analysis reveals a
moderate, positive correlation (r = `r cor_l2$estimate`). The p-value (p
= `r round(cor_l2$p.value, 4)`) is highly significant. This successfully
reproduces the paper's key finding: for nonnative speakers, higher
language analytic ability is associated with a larger vocabulary.


### *L1 Group Correlation:*

```{r}
#| label: cor-l1
#| echo: false

# Set a high penalty for scientific notation to force standard decimals and avoid p = 2.586e-06
options(scipen = 999)

# Filter for L1 group and run correlation test
cor_l1 <- cor.test(~ LgAnalysis + Vocab, data = filter(combined_data, Group == "L1"))
print(cor_l1)
```

*Interpretation (L1):* For the L1 group, the data show a strong positive
correlation (r =`r cor_l1$estimate`). This relationship is also highly statistically significant (p < .001). This finding is of particular interest as it appears to diverge from the conclusion in the original paper, where a relationship between`LgAnalysis`and vocabulary size was not found to be a significant factor for L1 speakers in the final model (p. 87).

# Data Visualization

## Visualizing the Group Difference

A boxplot provides a clear visual comparison of the score distributions
for the two groups.

```{r}
#| label: fig-boxplot
#| fig-cap: "Distribution of Language Analytic Ability Scores for L1 and L2 Speakers."
#| echo: false

# set.seed() makes the plot be the same every time we run this chunk since their horizontal placement is by default intentionally randomized
set.seed(123) 
# if not used, we get random points each time we run it

# ggplot
ggplot(combined_data, aes(x = Group, y = LgAnalysis, fill = Group)) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.1, alpha = 0.4) +
  labs(title = "Language Analytic Ability Scores: L1 vs. L2 Speakers",
       x = "Participant Group",
       y = "Language Analytic Ability Score") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("L1" = "#0072B2", "L2" = "#D55E00"))
```

*Interpretation:* This boxplot clearly shows that the entire
distribution for the L2 group (orange) is shifted upwards compared to
the L1 group (blue). The median, upper, and lower quartiles are all
higher, visually confirming the significant difference we found with the
t-test.

## Visualizing the Correlation with Vocabulary

A scatterplot is used to visualize the relationship between language
analytic ability and vocabulary scores for both groups.

```{r}
#| label: fig-scatterplot-simultaneously
#| fig-cap: "Relationship Between Language Analytic Ability and Vocabulary Scores, simultaneously."
#| echo: false

ggplot(combined_data, aes(x = LgAnalysis, y = Vocab, color = Group)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, aes(linetype = Group)) + # Add regression lines
  labs(title = "Language Analytic Ability and Vocabulary Scores",
       x = "Language Analytic Ability Score",
       y = "Vocabulary Score") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("L1" = "#0072B2", "L2" = "#D55E00"))
```

```{r}
#| label: fig-scatterplot-groups
#| fig-cap: "Relationship Between Language Analytic Ability and Vocabulary Scores, separated by group."
#| echo: false

ggplot(combined_data, aes(x = LgAnalysis, y = Vocab, color = Group)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~ Group) +
  labs(
    title = "Language Analytic Ability and Vocabulary Scores",
    x = "Language Analytic Ability Score",
    y = "Vocabulary Score"
  ) +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1")
```

**Interpretation:** The scatterplots reveal a clear, positive
relationship for both groups(an upward-sloping line). The trend is
evident not just for the L2 group, but also for the L1 group, visually
confirming that the correlation is present and significant in both
samples.

# Conclusion & Critical Analysis

This reproduction study successfully corroborates several key findings
from Dąbrowska (2019) regarding Language Analytic Ability, while also
highlighting an important nuance in the data that warrants discussion.

-   **Corroboration of Key Findings:** The analysis confirms two of the
    paper's central points. First, for L2 speakers, there is a
    **significant positive correlation** between their language analytic
    ability (`LgAnalysis`) and their vocabulary scores. This aligns
    perfectly with the author's regression analysis, which found
    `LgAnalysis` to be a significant predictor of vocabulary, accounting
    for 14% of the variance (**Table 6, p. 87**). Second, the direct
    t-test on the raw scores shows that L2 speakers **significantly
    outperform** L1 speakers on the Language Analysis test (p = 0.002).
    While Dąbrowska does not report this specific t-test, this finding
    is consistent with the broader patterns discussed in the paper.

-   **A Point of Divergence:** The most interesting finding of this
    reproduction is the direct, significant correlation between
    `LgAnalysis` and `Vocab` for the **L1 group** (r = 0.47, p \< .001).
    This appears to contradict the paper's conclusion, where the author
    states, **"\[...\] it is not clear why such a relationship is not
    observed in native speakers" (Dąbrowska, 2019, p. 87)**.

-   **Explaining the Discrepancy (Correlation vs. Regression):** This
    apparent contradiction is not an error but a reflection of differing
    analytical methods. Dąbrowska's conclusion stems from an *Ordinary
    Least Squares (OLS) multiple regression model* (**p. 85**), which
    assesses the *unique* predictive power of a variable after
    accounting for other factors. The model for L1 vocabulary (**Table
    5, p. 87**) includes print exposure (ART), nonverbal IQ (Blocks),
    and Age as significant predictors, but `LgAnalysis` does not appear.
    As Dąbrowska herself speculates, the effect of language analytic
    ability is likely **"\[...\] masked by the stronger effects of
    nonverbal IQ, which \[...\] is moderately strongly associated with
    it" (p. 87)**.

The findings in this reproduction study clarifie that while `LgAnalysis`
may not be a significant predictor for L1 vocabulary *in the presence of
other variables*, a simple, direct relationship between the two does
indeed exist in the data.

### R Implementation

This analysis was conducted in R. Key packages included the
**`tidyverse`** suite (**`dplyr`** & **`here`** for data manipulation
and **`ggplot2`** for visualization) and **`knitr`** for report
generation. Statistical inference was performed using base R functions,
specifically `t.test()` and `cor.test()`.
